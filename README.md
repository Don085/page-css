my css practice to make a page layout from scratch
i think it will be easy 


okay i made it in two days like 6 hr of work or something maybe less
i can say i really comfaartable now with html and css and it really amazes me i can do some much with only the basics
i mean this page looks like a real page on the web not just a begginer project
